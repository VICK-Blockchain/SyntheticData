# Synthetic HPV Immunization Data

To test the blockchain functionality of VICK, we created a synthetic dataset simulating HPV immunization records using a Python script which can be found [here](https://github.com/VICK-Blockchain/SyntheticData/blob/main/DentalData.py). This dataset includes realistic demographic and clinical information such as names, birthdates, gender, vaccine manufacturer, administration site, etc., generated using Python libraries like random, faker, datetime, and numpy. Demographic distributions were modeled on real-world statistics from the BigMouth Dental Data Repository to ensure accurate representation of patient characteristics. Each data element was assigned a unique VICK identifier via a second script which can be found [here](https://github.com/VICK-Blockchain/SyntheticData/blob/main/ID_Generation.py).
